We have tons of cool opportunities for budding techies to learn, develop, produce and tinker!

Our brand new Media suite means we have tons of cool things to play with and learn to use.


If you like:

- Cameras!
- Linux administration (Everyone loves it really...)
- Networking (I'd tell you a UDP joke, but you wouldn't get it)
- Looking after a fleet of Macs (Yes, really)
- Tons of coax (SO MUCH)
- Frantic shouting at live broadcast events (VT! VT! VT!)
- CasparCG (Because let's add another layer of complexity)
- Then get in touch! Hit contact us or email the Media Technical Manager (Luke Granger-Brown) at mediatec@imperial.ac.uk.
