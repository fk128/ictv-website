  - question: I want something filmed; can you do it for free?

  - question: >
      I am not a member, but I would like to hire equipment; how can I go about that?
    answer: >
      If you are not an Imperial Student, then you can only hire equipment at the non-member rate. To hire equipment, we need to be informed two weeks in advance. Conditions of hire can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzsQuDveh0kzZjAwOVRGMnhuRHc">here </a>.
      <br><br>If you are an Imperial Student, then there are two ways you can go about that:
      <ul><li>1. Buy ICTV membership and hire at the member rate;</li><li>2. Hire at the non-member rate.</li></ul>

      Can I borrow equipment for free?
    answer: >
      No, but if you are a member <strong>actively</strong> involved with ICTV, then you can, in some instances, borrow equipment for free for no more than two consecutive days. Actively involved means participating in ICTV filming projects, attending ICTV meeting, and/or making contributions of your time for the development of ICTV.

  - question: >
       I am a student, but not an Imperial College student; can I still join?
    answer: >
      Some external students can join ICTV. In order to do so, you would need to get an Imperial College Union associate membership. After you get that, you can buy ICTV membership from the Union website. You can find more details <a href=" https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/your-union/how-were-run/membership">here</a> about obtaining an associate membership from Imperial College Union. If you encounter any issues, do get in touch with us.
