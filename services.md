We provide filming, editing and equipment hire services to both internal and external groups. If you'd like to hire equipment you can find a partial list [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzsQuDveh0kzVnlMSDR5MG9DczA) - get in touch for more details.
  
ICTV consists of members that have different sets of skills and experiences, so filming and editing hire rates would depend on the quality of the final product you're looking for and the member's experience.
Some of our members have experience with filming conferences, concerts/events, lectures, short films, weddings, and live broadcasts.

If you would like to use our services, please send us a message to discuss your requirements and we'll be pleased to try to accommodate you as best as we can.
